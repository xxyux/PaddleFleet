"""Sparse attention over the **absorbed** MQA latent (``d_qk=576`` / ``d_v=512``).

Drives exactly the same kernel pair as ``csa_sparse_attn(backend="cudnn")``:

  - forward  ``paddlefleet.cudnn_ops.attn.csa_sparse_attn_fwd_cudnn
    .flash_mla_sparse_attn`` (FlashMLA sparse prefill)
  - backward ``paddlefleet.cudnn_ops.csa_sparse_attn_bwd_cudnn`` (cuDNN DSA)

It is kept as a separate ``PyLayer`` instead of a fourth ``backend`` branch of
``CSASparseAttention`` because the absorbed layout needs three things the 38
production CSA/HCA layers never do, none of which may leak onto that path:

1. **Asymmetric ``d_v``** -- query/key are 576 wide while the value is only the
   leading 512; CSA is symmetric.
2. **Optional sink** -- ``attn_sink=None`` means plain sinkless softmax,
   emulated with a per-head ``-1e30``; CSA always carries a learnable sink and
   ``csa_sparse_attn_utils.prepare_inputs`` unconditionally casts it.
3. **Query-head padding up to the DSA-fixed ``h_q == 64``**, plus (only on the
   ``d_qk != d_v`` kernel branch) a finite-sink LSE correction and an analytic
   ``d_sink``, because the SM100 backward returns an all-zero ``d_sink`` there.

Consumers: the hybrid-MLA non-absorbed MQA layers
(``paddlefleet.transformer.mqa_latent_attention``) and the HySparse block-sparse
gather branch (``paddlefleet.cudnn_ops.block_sparse_mqa_dsa``), which expands
its selected block ids into token columns first.
